# The official PestPHP news site

Coming soon...

This site is being built in public in the "Pest in Practice" series by [Luke Downing](https://github.com/lukeraymonddowning).
If you would like to contribute, we're open to ideas and PRs.

## Contributing

We always welcome contributions. Please ensure you include supporting tests for any new features or changes.

You will need a MailCoach licence to install the project's composer dependencies. If you are a member of the Pest Core team, please get in touch
with Luke Downing to get started.

If you are a member of the wider community, you can remove the `spatie/laravel-mailcoach` dependency from 
`composer.json` before running `composer install`. This will mean that certain parts of the application
will be broken for you, but the majority of the functionality will still be available as we do our 
best to isolate the core application from MailCoach.
