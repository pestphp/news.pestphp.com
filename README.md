# Opinionated Laravel Template

This is a template I use when starting a new Laravel project. It is opinionated and uses the conventions I prefer to work with day-in, day-out.

## Installation

You can create a new project via composer:

```bash
composer create-project lukeraymonddowning/laravel-template
```

## Toolset

The created application is configured with the following tools:

- [Pest PHP](https://pestphp.com)
- [Pest Parallel](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins/parallel)
- [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)
- [LaraStan](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan)
